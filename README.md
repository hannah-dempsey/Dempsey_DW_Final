# Dempsey_DW_Final

## Summary

This is the repository for my final project in Data Wrangling. I will be analyzing rodent survey data from Organ Pipe National Monument and Saguaro National Park. I will clean and summarize this data to visualize the community biomass and rodent abundance at each site and compare the changes between the two sites.

(Week 8: Problem Decomposition)

## Structure

code: contains all files in which coding is performed

-   cleaning_data: organizes and cleans data frame

-   saguaro_analysis and opri_analysis: analyse abundance and biomass data for each site

-   data_comparison: compares the abundance and biomass data of the two sites

data_raw: contains raw/unmodified data tables

data_clean: contains cleaned/modified data tables

figures: contains all produced figures

(Week 9: Contained in an RStudio Project with appropriate sub-directories and contains relative file paths)

(Week 10: This project can be found in a GitHub repository)

## Packages

tidyverse: used for cleaning and summarizing data
